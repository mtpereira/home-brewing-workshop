# Introduction

## Bio

- Manuel Pereira, former amateur coffee enthusiast, currently working as a
barista at doBeco.
- I've first started brewing coffee at home back in 2019 with an _electric_ moka
pot. That led me to find specialty coffee through Malabarista and 
Olisipo.
- And then I got a french press, another moka pot, a V60, an AeroPress... You
get the idea!

# Introduction

## Why do I brew coffee at home?

- So why do I brew coffee at home? Mostly because I find it simultaneously fun,
relaxing, engaging, and then I get to drink tasty coffee!
- Having the freedom to try any coffee whenever you like in the comfort of your
home is really great!
- Today I'll share with you how I approach brewing at home.
- I'll share with you how I typically brew with the french press, V60, and 
AeroPress, going over all the variables I consider when brewing with these 3 
very different brewers.
---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Coffee

- Specialty
- Roast profile
- Roast date
- Any and all coffee you haven't tried before!
---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Water

*Water is the most prevalent ingredient on your brew, keep that in mind!*

From worst to best, and from most convenient to less convenient:
- Tap water, and why you should avoid it in most situations/locations
- _Filtered_ tap water
- Mineral bottled water
- Distilled, remineralised water
---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Water

My personal choices:
- Brita's "Filter on tap": as convenient as it gets, perfect for morning coffee
- Third Wave Water: high TDS water that I've found to achieve a "juicy"
mouth feel and high clarity
- Perfect Coffee Water: for a more balanced cup

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Grinder

- Nothing beats fresh ground coffee
- Flexibility and autonomy
- Manual vs electric
- Burr types
- Why you'll likely end up spending at least 90 euro
- My recommendation: look for a hand grinder, filtered-centred burrs, and 
sub-40 seconds grind time

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Grinder

Some recommendations:
- 1zpresso ZP6 Special: Fits the bill perfectly, and the burrs elevate clarity
and acidity in the cup, which I'm unashamedly biased towards
- Timemore Chestnut C2: This is the bare minimum you should aim for, anything
below this and you'll find yourself wanting to upgrade very quickly

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Kettle

- A goose neck, while not essential, it elevates what you can do on a 
percolation brewer
- Different kettles will have different flows, and that impacts how you should
pour on percolation brewers
- Temperature control makes it easier to dial in temperature and play around
with how it affects your brew

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Kettle

Some recommendations:
- Fellow Stagg EKG: easiest flow to control (with the downside of only having
"one speed"), and an overall very ergonomic kettle
- Brewista Artisan: allows you to go super slow or super fast, and has some nice
features on its base (at the cost of simplicity)
- Hario V60 Drip Kettle AIR: a very affordable option that I personally enjoy 
using for travelling light

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Scales

- Why you'll need them
- Response time/lag
- Timer

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Scales

Some recommendations:
- Timemore Coffee Basic Plus: the most responsive and simple scales I've
used thus far, and at a reasonable price
- Any electronic kitchen scale with a decimal precision

# Recipes

## French press

Simple "cupping" recipe:
1. 1:16 ratio, medium-fine grind size
2. 4 minute steep time, after 8 minutes of brewing time

---

# Recipes

## V60: Matt Winton's 5 pour recipe

Very simple 1:16 ratio, provides a balanced cup
2. Pick an amount of coffee between 12 and 30 grams, multiply by 16.67, and 
divide by 5
3. Do 5 pours of the resulting amount, in a spiral motion, from centre to centre
4. Try to reduce coffee bed agitation on the last 2 pours

---

# Recipes

## V60: Lance Hedrick's 1-2-1 recipe

A long bloom, by doing a very precise pour to settle the coffee bed, that I 
find to increase aromas and clarity
1. Again a 1:16 ratio, with a 1/5 bloom and 4/5 long pour
1. The bloom should can be as long as 2 minutes, and that first pour should 
have the larger pebbles on top of the coffee bed, so that they act as a filter
1. The second pour should be circular, focused on the centre of the cone
