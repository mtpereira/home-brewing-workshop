# Introduction

## Bio

- Manuel Pereira, former amateur coffee enthusiast, currently working as a
barista at doBeco.
- I've first started brewing coffee at home back in 2019 with an _electric_ moka
pot. That led me to find specialty coffee through Malabarista and 
Olisipo.
- And then I got a french press, another moka pot, a V60, an AeroPress... You
get the idea!
---

# Introduction

## Why do I brew coffee at home?

- Mostly because I find it simultaneously fun,
relaxing, engaging, and then I get to drink tasty coffee!
- Having the freedom to try any coffee whenever you like in the comfort of your
home is really great!
- Don't seek perfection, focus on the process instead, enjoy it, and learn from
it.

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Coffee

- Specialty
- Roast profile
- Flavour notes
- Roast date (kind of...)
- Any coffee you haven't tried before!
---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Water

*Water is the most prevalent ingredient on your brew, keep that in mind!*

From worst to best, and from most convenient to less convenient:
- Tap water, and why you should avoid it in most situations/locations
- _Filtered_ tap water
- Mineral bottled water
- Distilled, remineralised water
---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Water

My personal choices for brewing at home:
- Brita's "Filter on tap": as convenient as it gets, perfect for morning coffee
- Third Wave Water: high TDS water that I've found to achieve a "juicy"
mouth feel and high clarity
- Perfect Coffee Water: for a more balanced cup

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Grinder

- Nothing beats fresh ground coffee
- Flexibility and autonomy
- Manual vs electric
- Burr types
- Why you'll likely end up spending at least 90 euro
- My recommendation: look for a hand grinder, filtered-centred burrs, with a 
sub-40 seconds grind time

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Grinder

Some recommendations:
- 1zpresso ZP6 Special: Fits the bill perfectly, and the burrs elevate clarity
and acidity in the cup, which I'm unashamedly biased towards
- Timemore Chestnut C2: This is the bare minimum you should aim for, anything
below this and you'll find yourself wanting to upgrade very quickly

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Kettle

- A goose neck, while not essential, it elevates what you can do on a 
percolation brewer
- Different kettles will have different flows, and that impacts how you should
pour on percolation brewers
- Temperature control makes it easier to dial in temperature and play around
with how it affects your brew

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Kettle

Some recommendations:
- Fellow Stagg EKG: easiest flow to control (with the downside of only having
"one speed"), and an overall very ergonomic kettle
- Brewista Artisan: allows you to go super slow or super fast, and has some nice
features on its base (at the cost of simplicity)
- Hario V60 Drip Kettle AIR: a very affordable option that I personally enjoy 
using for travelling light

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Scales

- Why you'll need them
- Response time/lag
- Timer

---

# What do you need to brew coffee at home?

## Scales

Some recommendations:
- Timemore Coffee Basic Plus: the most responsive and simple scales I've
used thus far, and at a reasonable price
- Any electronic kitchen scale with a decimal precision

# Recipes

## French press

Simple "cupping" recipe:
1. 1:16 ratio, medium-fine grind size
2. 4 minute steep time, after 8 minutes of brewing time

---

# Recipes

## V60: Matt Winton's 5 pour recipe

Very simple 1:16 ratio, provides a balanced cup
2. Pick an amount of coffee between 12 and 30 grams, multiply by 16.67, and 
divide by 5
3. Do 5 pours of the resulting amount, in a spiral motion, from centre to centre
4. Try to reduce coffee bed agitation on the last 2 pours

---

# Recipes

## V60: Lance Hedrick's 1-2-1 recipe

A long bloom, by doing a very precise pour to settle the coffee bed, that I 
find to increase aromas and clarity
1. Again a 1:16 ratio, with a 1/5 bloom and 4/5 long pour
1. The bloom should can be as long as 2 minutes, and that first pour should 
have the larger pebbles on top of the coffee bed, so that they act as a filter
1. The second pour should be circular, focused on the centre of the cone

---

# Recipes

## AeroPress: Stir-and-bypass recipe

My go-to recipe, inverted position, usually provides punchy acidity and clarity
1. ~1:10 ratio, 18 grams of medium-coarse/coarse ground coffee, 200 ml of water
2. Add 100 ml of water, stir gently for around 45 seconds
3. Let it steep for 30 seconds or so while you rinse 2 AeroPress filters
4. Place the cap on, and pull the plunger down to remove extraneous air
5. Place the AeroPress on a server, swirl to dislodge coffee grounds from the 
plunger's rubber end, and press gently and slowly, for about 30 seconds.
6. By-pass with room temperature water with 100 ml of water

---

# Recipes

## AeroPress: Bloom & immersion recipe

A simple to follow standard position recipe
1. ~1:15 ratio, 14 grams of medium-fine ground coffee, 200 ml of water
2. Bloom for 30 seconds with 50 ml of water
3. Add the remaining water, stir 3 times, and put the plunger on
4. Let it steep for 1 minute, and then remove the plunger and stir 3 times
5. Place the plunger again, and press gently and slowly, for about 30 seconds
